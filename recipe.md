Preheat the oven to 375. Line a light-colored baking sheet with a silicone mat.
In a medium bowl, beat the butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy, about 20 seconds.
Add the sugars, and beat for about 30 seconds. The mixture will turn a pale color and be fluffy.
Next, add the vanilla and beat until just combined.
Whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and espresso powder in a separate bowl.
Sprinkle the flour on top of the butter mixture, and beat just until combined.
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Chill the dough uncovered in the fridge for 30 minutes. You can store it overnight, but let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before using then.
Scoop the dough into 8 dough balls, and space them evenly on the baking sheet.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, removing the cookies from the oven when the edges just start to turn golden brown.
Let the cookies rest on the baking sheet for 1 minute before moving them to a wire rack to cool.
